Description: Suite of tools that facilitate
    exposure-response analysis using Bayesian methods. The package
    provides a streamlined workflow for fitting types of models that are
    commonly used in exposure-response analysis - linear and Emax for continuous
    endpoints, logistic linear and logistic Emax for binary endpoints, as well
    as performing simulation and visualization. Learn more about the workflow
    at <https://genentech.github.io/BayesERbook/>.
