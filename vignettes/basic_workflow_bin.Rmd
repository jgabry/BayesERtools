This vignette provides a basic workflow for the development of ER models for
binary endpoints and subsequent simulation from the developed ER model.

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(BayesERtools)
rlang::check_installed("xgxr")

ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 12))
```

## Data

We will use an example simulated dataset included in the package 
(`d_sim_binom_cov`) for the analysis.
In this document we use hypoglycemia (hgly2) as an example AE. Another example
AE is diarrhea (dr2), where you would see fairly flat ER curve.

```{r}
data(d_sim_binom_cov)

head(d_sim_binom_cov) |>
  gt::gt() |>
  gt::fmt_number(n_sigfig = 3)

d_sim_binom_cov_2 <-
  d_sim_binom_cov |>
  mutate(
    AUCss_1000 = AUCss / 1000, BAGE_10 = BAGE / 10,
    BWT_10 = BWT / 10, BHBA1C_5 = BHBA1C / 5,
    Dose = paste(Dose_mg, "mg")
  )

# Grade 2+ hypoglycemia
df_er_ae_hgly2 <- d_sim_binom_cov_2 |> filter(AETYPE == "hgly2")
# Grade 2+ diarrhea
df_er_ae_dr2 <- d_sim_binom_cov_2 |> filter(AETYPE == "dr2")
```

We also defines variables that is used in the analysis.

```{r}
var_resp <- "AEFLAG"
# HbA1c & glucose are only relevant for hyperglycemia
var_cov_ae_hgly2 <-
  c("BAGE_10", "BWT_10", "RACE", "VISC", "BHBA1C_5", "BGLUC")
var_cov_ae_dr2 <-
  c("BAGE_10", "BWT_10", "RACE", "VISC")
```


## 1. Basic model development

`dev_ermod_bin()` function can be used to develop basic ER model. (Note that
this function can also be used for models with covariates, if you already know
the covariates to be included.)

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
ermod_bin <- dev_ermod_bin(
  data = df_er_ae_hgly2,
  var_resp = var_resp,
  var_exposure = "AUCss_1000"
)
ermod_bin
```

You can compare the observed data with the model fit using `plot_er()` 
function.

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
# Using `*` instead of `+` so that scale can be
# applied for both panels (main plot and boxplot)
plot_er_gof(ermod_bin, var_group = "Dose", show_coef_exp = TRUE) *
  xgxr::xgx_scale_x_log10()
```

MCMC samples can be obtained with `as_draws()` family of functions, such as
`as_draws_df()`.

```{r}
draws_df <- as_draws_df(ermod_bin)

draws_df_summary <-
  posterior::summarize_draws(draws_df)

draws_df_summary |>
  gt::gt() |>
  gt::fmt_number(n_sigfig = 3)
```


You can predict the probability of events for a given exposure level with
`sim_er_new_exp()` function.

Here, the prediction is done for AUCss_1000 of 1, 2, 3 (AUCss of 1000, 2000, 
3000), and the output is the median and 95% CI of the predicted probability.
You can set `output_type = "draw"` to get the raw posterior draws.

```{r}
ersim_med_qi <- sim_er_new_exp(
  ermod_bin,
  exposure_to_sim_vec = 1:3,
  output_type = "median_qi"
)
ersim_med_qi
```

## 2. Selection of exposure metrics

`dev_ermod_bin_exp_sel()` function can be used to select the best exposure
metric(s) from a list of candidate exposure metrics. In this case, AUCss_1000
is selected as the best exposure metric, as it had the highest elpd (expected 
log predictive density).[^1]

[^1]: Some references about elpd: \code{?loo::`loo-glossary`}, [What is the interpretation of ELPD / elpd_loo / elpd_diff?](https://mc-stan.org/loo/articles/online-only/faq.html#elpd_interpretation)

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
ermod_bin_exp_sel <-
  dev_ermod_bin_exp_sel(
    # Use reduced N to make the example run faster
    data = slice_sample(df_er_ae_hgly2, n = 100),
    var_resp = var_resp,
    var_exp_candidates = c("AUCss_1000", "Cmaxss", "Cminss"),
    # Use reduced iter to make the example run faster
    iter = 1000
  )
ermod_bin_exp_sel
```

The ER curve for all the evaluated exposure metrics can be generated with 
`plot_er_exp_sel()` function.

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
plot_er_exp_sel(ermod_bin_exp_sel) +
  xgxr::xgx_scale_x_log10()
```


## 3. Selection of covariates

`dev_ermod_bin_cov_sel()` function can be used to select the best covariates
from a list of candidate covariates. In this case, HbA1c (BHBA1C_5) and glucose
(BGLUC) are selected, in addition to the exposure metric AUCss_1000 as 
predictors.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
ermod_bin_cov_sel <-
  dev_ermod_bin_cov_sel(
    data = df_er_ae_hgly2,
    var_resp = var_resp,
    var_exposure = "AUCss_1000",
    var_cov_candidate = var_cov_ae_hgly2,
    verbosity_level = 2
  )
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# Save the output in vignettes/data to avoid running it during the build.
saveRDS(ermod_bin_cov_sel, file = "data/ermod_bin_cov_sel.rds")
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
ermod_bin_cov_sel <- readRDS("data/ermod_bin_cov_sel.rds")
```

```{r}
ermod_bin_cov_sel
```

The plot below shows that AUCss_1000, BHBA1C_5, and BGLUC contributes to 
improving the model performance, and after then the inclusion of no other
covariates improves the model performance.

```{r}
plot_submod_performance(ermod_bin_cov_sel)
```

In some cases, you might see a warning message like below. This indicates that
approximation of leave-one-out cross-validation performance (PSIS-LOO) is not
reliable.

```
Warning: In the recalculation of the reference model's PSIS-LOO CV weights for 
the performance evaluation, ... Pareto k-values are in the interval...`. 
```

Alternatively to the default `cv_method = "LOO"`, you can use k-fold 
cross-validation by setting`cv_method = "kfold"` in `dev_ermod_bin_cov_sel()` 
function. This can take longer time to run, but it can be more reliable in
the cases where LOO is not reliable. You can also set `validate_search = TRUE`
to let the function perform the variable selection for each fold separately,
rather than using the selected variable sequence from the full dataset
evaluation. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
ermod_bin_cov_sel_kfold <-
  dev_ermod_bin_cov_sel(
    data = df_er_ae_hgly2,
    var_resp = var_resp,
    var_exposure = "AUCss_1000",
    var_cov_candidate = var_cov_ae_hgly2,
    cv_method = "kfold",
    validate_search = TRUE,
    verbosity_level = 2
  )
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# Save the output in vignettes/data to avoid running it during the build.
saveRDS(ermod_bin_cov_sel_kfold, file = "data/ermod_bin_cov_sel_kfold.rds")
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
ermod_bin_cov_sel_kfold <- readRDS("data/ermod_bin_cov_sel_kfold.rds")
```

Added bonus of using k-fold cv is that you can visualize how often each 
variable is selected in the model. Here, as you can see (and as expected),
HbA1c (BHBA1C_5) and glucose (BGLUC) are highly related and they are almost
interchangeably selected in the second and third positions. 
Note that the function enforces the exposure metric to be included 
first in the model.

```{r}
ermod_bin_cov_sel_kfold
plot_submod_performance(ermod_bin_cov_sel_kfold)
plot_var_ranking(ermod_bin_cov_sel_kfold)
```

## 4. Marginal ER prediction

You can simulate the marginal ER relationship, i.e. ER relationships for
"marginalized", or averaged, response for the population of interest,
using `sim_er_new_exp_marg()` function.
By default, the covariate distribution is from the original data, but you can
also supply other distribution with `data_cov` argument.

```{r}
ersim_new_exp_marg_med_qi <- sim_er_new_exp_marg(
  ermod_bin_cov_sel,
  exposure_to_sim_vec = c(2:6),
  output_type = "median_qi"
)
ersim_new_exp_marg_med_qi

plot_er(ersim_new_exp_marg_med_qi, marginal = TRUE)
```

## 5. Evaluation of covariate effects

You can visualize the effect of the covariates with `sim_coveff()` and
`plot_coveff()` functions. You can see that all three predictors have 
fairly strong effects on the odds ratio of hypoglycemia.

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4.5}
coveffsim <- sim_coveff(ermod_bin_cov_sel)
plot_coveff(coveffsim)
print_coveff(coveffsim)
```
